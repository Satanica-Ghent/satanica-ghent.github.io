Through the gates of Hell, as we make our way to Heaven
Through the Nazi lines - Primo Victoria!

We've been training for years, now we're ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We're the first waves on shore, we're the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers have fallen before

In the dawn, they will pay - with their lives as the price!
History's written today
In this burning inferno, know that nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach

Aiming for Heaven, though serving in Hell
Victory's ours, their forces will fall!

Through the gates of Hell, as we make our way to Heaven
Through the Nazi lines - Primo Victoria!
On the 6th of June, on the shores of western Europe
1944 - D-Day upon us!

We've been here before, used to this kind of war
Crossfire grind through the sand
Our orders were easy - it's "kill or be killed!"
Blood on both sides will be spilled!

In the dawn, they will pay - with their lives as the price!
History's written today!
Now that we are at war with the Axis again
This time we know what will come!

Aiming for Heaven, though serving in Hell
Victory's ours, their forces will fall!

Through the gates of Hell, as we make our way to Heaven
Through the Nazi lines - Primo Victoria!
On the 6th of June, on the shores of western Europe
1944 - D-Day upon us!

6th of June, 1944 - Allies are turning the war!
Normandy, state of anarchy - Overlord!

Aiming for Heaven, though serving in Hell
Victory's ours, their forces will fall!

Through the gates of Hell, as we make our way to Heaven
Through the Nazi lines - Primo Victoria!
On the 6th of June, on the shores of western Europe
1944 - D-Day upon us!

Through the gates of Hell, as we make our way to Heaven
Through the Nazi lines - Primo Victoria!
On the 6th of June, on the shores of western Europe
1944 - Primo Victoria!
