Cut through the clouds
With the speed of a demon
I am as I was as I will be
Lord of this world can you hear me I’m screaming
God above all things beneath me

Oh wah-ha-ha-ha
What a sensation (x2)
Can you feel it
Can you see what I see
I’m drowning in light
The lights

Ladies and gentlemen
Your hero has returned again
Everything is going to be okay-ay-ay-ay
Ladies and gentlemen
Your shepherd and your very best friend
Bow your head, the man is here
To stay-ay-ay-ay

Pitiful one you speak without seeing
Intruder, you came uninvited
The hunt has begun and soon you’ll be bleeding
Stare at the night sky ignited

Oh wah-ha-ha-ha
What a sensation (x2)
Can you feel it
Can you see what I see
I’m drowning in light
The lights

Ladies and gentlemen
Your hero has returned again
Everything is going to be okay-ay-ay-ay
Ladies and gentlemen
Your shepherd and your very best friend
Bow your head, the man is here
To stay-ay-ay-ay

Ladies and gentlemen
Your hero has returned again
Everything is going to be okay-ay-ay-ay
Ladies and gentlemen
Your shepherd and your very best friend
Bow your head, the man is here
To stay-ay-ay-ay

La (x32)
