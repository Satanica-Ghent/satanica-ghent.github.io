Hey hey hey!

When I first set myself on the road, I was struck by sights untold
By the sea and across the lands, with a calming drinking hand
Italian way! Grappa grappa hey! Deutschland lager, Ã¼ber alles!
If Aquavit left me feeling bleak, a pint of Bitters we'll make me cheers!

Hey hey hey!
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
Hey hey hey!
I will lead this way, until the fall of my final time!
Hey hey hey!
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
Hey hey hey!
I will lead this way, until the fall of my final time!

Spirits are high tonight, mostly of bottled king
Our clan is gathered here, and the plan is loud and clear!
Everyone in full swing, brothers of kin will attempt to sing!
No one cares what tomorrow brings, and the sauna burns down again!

Hey hey hey!
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
Hey hey hey!
I will lead this way, until the fall of my final time!
Hey hey hey!
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
Hey hey hey!
I will lead this way, until the fall of my final time!

Hey! Hey! Hey! x3
I'm a man with a plan!

Hey hey hey!
I'm a man with a plan!

Hey Hey Hey! (push it!)
Hey Hey Hey!
Hey Hey Hey!
