Oh, when the night comes back
All my fears and doubts
Get my hand to choose the way
To end this masquerade
You were my only star
My light in the dark
One drop in your wine
And all this pain will fade away

Now our running tears (now our running tears)
For my better heal (for my better heal)
Ringing the bell
Someone is dead

Goodbye, my love
May we meet again
Heaven is closed
See you in Hell
Goodbye, my love
For you rings the bell
I've no remorse
See you in Hell
See you in Hell

I give my trust and heart
To a troubled man
Never satisfied my love
You threw it away
Now your soul in the clouds
I look at the sky
Can you see me smile?
I don’t regret in anyway

This last glass of wine (this last glass of wine)
Then your heart was mine (then your heart was mine)
So will it be for eternity!

Goodbye, my love
May we meet again
Heaven is closed
See you in Hell
Goodbye, my love
For you rings the bell
I've no remorse
See you in Hell

{Pre-Chorus 1]
Ringing the bells
Someone is dead

Goodbye, my love
May we meet again
Heaven is closed
See you in Hell
Goodbye, my love
For you rings the bell
I've no remorse
See you in Hell
