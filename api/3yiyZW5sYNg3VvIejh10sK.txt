Since dawn of time the fate of man is that of lice
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes
A day of reckoning when penance is to burn
Countdown together now and say the words
That you will learn

Crestfallen kings and queens comforting in their faith
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the Wraith
Since fate of man is equal to the fate of lice
As new dawn rises, you shalt recognize
Now, behold the Lord of Flies

Hell Satan

[Guitar Solo: Nameless Ghoul (Fire)]

He will tremble the nations
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations
A daughter to fall for a son
The ancient serpent deceiver
To masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of God
