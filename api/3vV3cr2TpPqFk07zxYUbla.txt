Come on, feel the noise
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

So you think I got an evil mind
I tell you honey
I don't know why
I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time
It makes me money
I don't know why, I don't know why
Anymore, oh no

So come on, feel the noise
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Baby!

So you say I got a funny face
I got no worries
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Oh I gotta sing with some disgrace
I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, no, no, no

So come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild, baby
Come on!

Well, you think we have a lazy time
You should know better
I don't know why
I don't know why
So you say I got a dirty mind
I'm a mean go-getter
I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, oh no

So come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Baby!

Come on, (come on) feel it
Girls rock your boys (come on, rock it!)
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We're gonna get wild! (wild, wild, wild)
We're gonna get rocked tonight (come on, feel the noise)
Rock it tonight (girls rock your boys)
We'll get wild, wild, wild
OH YEAH!!
Ah, ah, ah (woo!)
Ah, ah, ah
Come on, feel the noise, girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
