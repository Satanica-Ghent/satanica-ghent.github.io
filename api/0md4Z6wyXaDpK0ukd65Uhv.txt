There's a Devil inside of me
And he's holding on
And I don't know if he's staying
Or for how long
Pulling my heartstrings
And kicking in my mind
And I'm sad to say
He got me thinking about the bad parts of my life

There's a devil inside me
A monolith of doom
And there's on inside of you
A terrible terrorist
Tormenting me in my abyss
And I don't know how to stop him
Or if it's even a problem

There's a devil inside of me
A monolith of doom
And there's one inside of you
Tell me how do you deal
With the a devil in your heart
Cause every time i think we're done
I find him right back at the start

There's a devil inside of me
And he's holding on
Pulling my heartstrings
And kicking in my mind
And I'm sad to say
He got me thinking about the bad parts of my life

There's a devil inside me
A monolith of doom
And there's on inside of you
A terrible terrorist
Tormenting me at my best
And I don't know how to stop him
Or if it's even a problem

There's a Devil inside of me
And he's holding on
And I don't know if he's staying
Or for how long
Pulling my heartstrings
And kicking in my mind
And I'm sad to say
He got me thinking about the bad parts of my life
